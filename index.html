<p> <i>Beep Beep - Beep Beep</i>…”I really cannot deal with this right now”, Cathy sighed in<span class = "revealTest1"> frustration.</span> She tugged a bit harder on the thread weaving through her beanie. Cathy had been at it for hours, <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest2">losing her track of time </span>as she ignored the amount of work the house needed. “It’s crocheting” she muttered, “There’s always time for crocheting”. <i>Beep Beep-Beep Beep </i> “Ugh Carla! Could you check where that’s coming from?” She faintly hoped her daughter heard her yelling. However, given that Carla was just 5, and with the numerous rooms and the size of this place, even <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> Cathy would get overwhelmed</span> herself. Besides, hearing someone all across over the west wing, from the master bedroom was unlikely anyway.</p>


<p>It had been about a few weeks since she moved into the archaic but grand looking mansion. As she pulled through another loop of her thread, Cathy glanced around the room she was in. The huge french windows surrounded by their sturdy grey marble panes were a sight to <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> her sore eyes</span>- well except for the <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest2"> barricaded bars across</span> them that ruined the view. “How filthy rich were the previous owners that they needed THIS level of protection”, Cathy pondered.She could still peek through them and bask in the view of the seemingly never ending stretch of corn fields all around- abruptly cutting off to part for the highway that led to the city. Reaching down under the bed, Cathy felt around the wood carvings on the bed frame that almost every furniture in the place had. She gently traced the intricate design with her fingertips: A beautiful archaic blend of carved dragons and soft spiral curves that felt pleasing to her touch as much as to her sight. They felt almost <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> similar to the ones she could remember from her childhood home</span>, Cathy thought. </p>

<p>Sure the place was too big to manage as a single mom and yes, the leftover equipment from the previous homeowners lying around, wasn’t helping her case either.But, hey, it was New Orleans! The most peaceful locality one could move to, not a soul surrounding her place for quite the distance; A perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of NYC. It’s a shame, they had to move out when her previous apartment got involved in the fire accident, but she’s getting accustomed to the calmness; In some weird or not so weird sort of fashion <span class="hlpin2"> the house seemed familiarly comforting to Cathy.</span>
</p>
<p>As she let her mind run through these thoughts, <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> she noticed how well this room suited her likings</span> : A perfect queen size bed with an innerspring mattress, the perfect distance of the closet from the bed and it's orientation, which, now that she thought about it-  she probably moved it herself when she came in there the first time, anyway she was too exhausted to remember if she did do it. Even the wallpaper was just slightly off from her favorite shade of purple! ”What else could a woman ask for?” Cathy grinned to herself, the crocheting now on autopilot as <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest2"> her thoughts kept drifting around in a seance</span>. Her smile soon dropped slightly when she thought about Carla. Carla wasn’t really fond of the place. She kept crying and throwing tantrums that did <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> hit Cathy’s nerves</span> now and then, and managing the house while taming Carla was a real chore. But a chore that she was ready to put up with. <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest2"> <i>She loved Carla to death.</i></span>Probably the only reason she's been so positive through the whole change. Today the house seemed a bit quiet though, or maybe <i>too quiet</i>. 
</p>
<p>“Who even sets an alarm at <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> 11:30</span> in the morning” she cried with a pause on her thoughts, unwillingly leaving her half done beanie to find and stop whatever alarm or clock that was.
  As she turned the doorknob and walked out,she hears someone with a burly voice say something that no mother would ever want to hear:  “You go take care of the kid, I'll make sure <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest2"> she doesn’t do anything she’ll regret”.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> Their lives</span> were about to take a turn…<i>for the worse.</i></p><br><br><br><br>

  “Give me the pills ”, another voice echoed through the house.<i>There were two of them.</i> Cathy started <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> feeling jittery</span> as she heard the footsteps of the men go in opposite directions, one swiftly approaching the stairway to her room while the other towards the west wing. Her <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest2"> vision blurred</span> as the sound of her heart thumping was seemingly out of sync with her actual heartbeat. <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> <i>She was losing it…</i></span>. <b>CARLA</b>. That was her focus,Carla. She had to make it through this to make sure no one hurts her baby girl. A small vent-like closet stood just outside her room. “That's my only chance”. As gently but as quickly as she could, Cathy slipped in and shut the closet doors on herself,missing the attacker by just a few seconds. She watched the man walk into her room and stop for a second“Fuck..Goddamnit She’s not in her room”, he whispered underneath his breath. </p>

  <p>Cathy was confused, how did the man know she would be in the room, why was it surprising that she's out of the room anyway?, Was it to make things easier for him?Make what things easier though? What did they want? Her <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest2"> head started pounding furiously</span> as the questions stabbed her mind like needles coupled with her <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> fear and anxiety.</span>If only she could see his face, that could have hinted at something, but the tiny slits of the closet door obfuscated her view. She realized it probably didn't matter anyway since she didn’t know anyone from New Orleans. But no time for questions right now, she had to get to the west wing. </p>

  <p>Cathy snuck out of the closet when it felt safe, as after looking around the room, he entered the  attached bathroom. Her eyes were so focused on the door she wasn’t paying attention to what she was walking into- <i><b>CRASHH!</b></i> Cathy bumped into the big China vase standing in the corner of the room. It was too late- the man swung out of the bathroom as she saw him stare at her menacingly. Cathy started to go through another panic attack. But this time it was different, this time it was fueled by an <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest2"> outburst of anger and frustration.</span> All she wanted was a break, she wanted to be happy, she just wanted to be alone with her daughter, not murdered or robbed or kidnapped from her own house..She had to do something about it. <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> She would do anything to get back her life. </span>
  </p>

  <p>The man slowly took steps towards her with an intimidating sense of confidence.He reached into his pocket slowly maintaining eye contact as he spoke, “Take these pills befor-" In a split second decision, Cathy lunged at the man and shoved the knitting needle that she grabbed from the shelf next to her, into his upper body. The needle struck the man in his chest as he groaned in pain. It clearly took him by surprise as <span class = "revealTest2"> he didn’t expect Cathy to attack him.</span> She continued stabbing his chest relentlessly until he slowed down trying to resist and finally gave up. Cathy wasted no time as she quickly used the yarn lying around to tie his arms to the bed frame making sure he couldn’t move. His voice sounded muffled to her with the adrenaline rushing through her head but she could still see his chest heaving</p>

  <p><i>At least she didn’t murder him</i>,Cathy was relieved . “The cops should take care of him, she thought to herself as she searched his pants for his phone. A she patted his pants down a bottle of pills rolled down the floor. Prolixin-it read out. The name seemed familiar, probably on the OMITB podcast she listens to. Cathy never thought she would actually be involved in a story that could possibly feature on a true crime podcast . She found the phone in his breast pocket and quickly dialed 911 running through the whole predicament. “Our units will be at your location in 55 minutes. Please remain calm-''. She quickly stood up and dashed to the door making her way to the west wing, limping slightly from the altercation.
</p>

<p><i>55 minutes....she couldn’t wait that long,Carla needed her.</i></p><br><br><br><br>

                    <p>For once Cathy was glad the house was big enough to pull off something like this.Hopefully it bought her enough time to reach Carla before the other maniac did. <i>Hopefully.</i> She started slow jogging across the hallway, the soft velvety carpet occasionally getting stained with imprints of her bloody footsteps. She made her way to the corridor with Carla’s playroom, or rather the room that Carla baptised as her playroom."Such an adorable kid", Cathy smiled in the midst of all the stress.</p>


<p>Her smile was soon short lived as Carla’s muffled whimpering voice came through to her, “Someone, help me please”. She burst the door open and froze, there was Carla on her playchair, tears streaming down her face with her waist tied to the chair so tightly one could see the bruises as she struggled to get loose. Her mouth was stuffed with a plushie toy to keep her from making noises. Cathy stood there for what felt like an eternity as she tried to move towards Carla. But <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> her anxiety, her anger</span> towards whoever did this kicked in again as she looked at her daughter like that. <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> “I’m sorry mommy-”</span>whispered Carla as she got more fidgety trying to loosen her bonds. Cathy snapped out of her trance for a moment after hearing that. “No sweetie you did nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about ,mommy will fix this i swear-” Her voice cracked as she bent down to try to untie whatever was used to tie Carla up. <br>“What the -”, It was the other man, staring at Cathy in a shocked but confused manner, probably because his partner should have drugged her by now she thought, instead here she was foiling their plans by rescuing Carla. Her <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> vision blurred </span>with tears and her head started pounding back again.
</p>


<p><span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest2"> <i>Cathy blacked out. </i></span></p>

<p>What happened next, Cathy does not remember, all she knows, is that she was now on top of the slightly older looking man in the middle of the doorway with blood trickling down his head from a deep gash. A quick glance at the bloodied doorway column on the left where he was now lying, made her realize that she had charged at him,hard enough to knock him against it and cause some bleeding. Cathy was horrified by what she had done as she took a second to process all that just happened.</p>

<p>As she slowly gained focus and zoned back in,  Carla’s shrieking voice was slowly seeping back into her head in the background. Cathy turned around to see most of the stuff that Carla was tied up with, had loosened enough for her to start crying and fidgeting hysterically .The blood, being tied up and whatever happened during her blackout had messed up Carla even more than she already was. Cathy quickly jumped in for a hug to calm her down, giving her a tight hug. “It’s going to be okay” Cathy reassured her, as she rocked Carla to sleep in her arms in a motherly way, Cathy <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> hugged her as tightly as she could</span>, not wanting to let go of her for the <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest2"> rest of her life</span>, if given the possibility .
  “Just fall asleep Carla, I’ll take care of this, I promise. Just please sleep”-her voice croaked. She continued for a while trying to contain her own tears, not really sure how she would or whether she even could handle this situation after this. Carla now <span id = "reveal" class = "revealTest1"> slowly and softly began to stop crying and thrashing around</span>   after a few minutes,and was now snuggly resting her head on Cathy’s shoulders. Cathy gently picked her up, and laid her on the bed. She patted Carla’s head and once again smiled through her tears.
 </p>

<p>
  <i>BEEP-BEEP. The sound was back,</i> this time from a device in the room. “Ungh-” Cathy turned back instantaneously as she saw  the man groan and stir a bit . He was half conscious now; looking at her with tears in his eyes the man asks: “Why would you do that, Cathy?” 
  </p>
  <p><i><b>He knew her name.</b></i></p>

        “How do you know my name? Why are you here??” Cathy screamed at the man desperately, she knew he was about to go unconscious again and <i>she needed answers.</i> With a failed attempt at talking, all the man could do was point his finger towards the beeping device,”Take care of her”, he whispered hurtingly as his body went limp and his hand came crashing down. Cathy rushed towards the tablet like device, Had she seen it before? Turning the screen on revealed a series of audio log files as if they were made to document something, 
  Scrolling past the log files she found the most recent file was a digital text note made earlier that morning: 

        </p>
  
        <p>
          “Back soon, Town Hall meeting, Take your meds sweetheart, remember, I’ll be checking my phone.    
            Love you.
               - Nathan”
          
          
          </p>
          <p>Cathy didn’t understand what the note was talking about, the name felt muddled in her head along with the rest of her thoughts. She scrolled up the screen with her fingers trembling , skipping past other audio and note files as she reached the first file created on the device,a file named “Log 1” which had a star on it. Cathy clicked on it, unsure of what she was about to hear:</p>
          
      <audio  id="myAudio" controls >
        
        <source src="Log1.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      Your browser does not support the audio element.
      </audio>
      <div id="hiddenText">

    
      
      <p>Cathy was bewildered. What the hell did any of that mean? She wasn’t sick, why were they making that up, it didn’t make any sense to her. “I’m fine, they want to pin this on me”, she realized. Faint sirens were echoing from the outside as multiple cop cars were zooming down the road to the mansion. Her face went pale. The tablet, the unconscious men, they’d lie to the cops, “They’ll take Carla away from”, she thought to herself. Cathy turned towards Carla and watched her stir at around the same time , she rushed towards her and knelt by Carla’s bedside and started nudging her,”Sweetie wake up lets go”. “Where mommy?” Carla asked in a groggy voice. Cathy picked her up and turned her away from the bloodshed as they walked towards the backdoor. “Mommy’s going to fix this, we’ll make it through this, okay?” “Why don’t we sing the Barney song to keep us company ?” Cathy asked her. “I thought you didn’t like that song…” “Oh come on! I was kidding when I said that”. They both giggled as Cathy walked through the corn fields through a narrow farm path, opposite the direction of the highway. 
      </p>
      
    <p > <b><i>"Hey, hey, hey, what do you say?<br>
      It's time to boogie woogie in a Barney way<br>
      Can you say "Yeah, I wanna play"<br>

      Hey, hey, hey, today's the day<br>
      To boogie oogie woogie the day away"<br><br></i></b>
      </p>
<p>Carla smiled as Cathy tried to join in while cradling her to the beat of the song making Carla giggle. “I love you mommy” Carla stopped her song as Cathy heard her whisper, “I love you too, sweetheart”.

<p>The residents of New Orleans awoke to a solemn atmosphere the subsequent morning as news of a distressing incident at the Greens Mansion unfolded. Law enforcement officials disseminated preliminary the following details: <br><i>The deceased bodies of its inhabitants, Nathan Bridgers (35), Oliver Green (58), and, in a heart-wrenching revelation, Carla Bridgers, the 5-year-old daughter of Nathan and Cathy Bridgers (34), were found brutally murdered by first responders. Mr. Bridgers succumbed to injuries resulting from 13 stab wounds inflicted by a knitting needle to his chest, while Mr. Green succumbed to fatal bleeding stemming from a head injury. The autopsy report elucidated that Carla's cause of death was suffocation and broken ribs, indicative of a violent squeezing action. Additionally, injuries from knitting yarn around her arms and legs indicated that the child had been bound for an extended period prior to the tragic murders. </i></p>

<p><i>Cathy Bridgers (34) [ Wife to Nathan, daughter of Oliver and mother to Carla ] , who also allegedly called the cops herself earlier that day on a false pretence of burglars, has been declared a suspect and is now on the run. With medical reports found at the location, Cathy Bridgers is known to be mentally unstable and considered a threat to anyone and everyone around. Citizens are requested to report any information to their local authorities immediately </i></p>

<p>Somewhere out there Cathy is singing the Barney song with Carla. She doesn’t remember the lyrics but Carla still enjoys her half mumbled half hummed lyrics anyway.Cathy had said she would do anything to protect Carla. <br>  <br><br>  After all...<i> she loved her to death.</i>
